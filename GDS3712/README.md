### Grandstream GDS3712 Single-Gang Mounting Adapter and Oversized Wall Plate

This is a single-gang box mounting plate adapter for the Grandstream GDS3712 doorbell/intercom. It may also work with other similar GDS37xx models such as the GDS3702, GDS3705, and GDS3710.

This was designed to use the stock steel mounting plate intended for flush mount on a wall, and adapt that to a standard North American single-gang electrical box.

You will also need:
- 4 - #8 x 1/2" machine screws (to mount the stock plate to the adapter)
- 4 - #8 machine screw nuts (optional)
- 2 - 6-32 UNC thread screws (to mount the adapter to the electrical box)

The #8 screws should thread directly into the 3D printed plastic, however you may optionally also use 4 corresponding #8 nuts to re-inforce the attachment from behind the adapter plate. If using nuts, first thread the screws in place, then attach the nuts from behind the plate to ensure proper thread alignment. I would then recommend using a small dab of cyanoacrylate glue (Super Glue) to hold the nuts in place. You can then disassemble the steel plate from the bracket to re-expose the slots needed to mount the adapter to the electrical box.

I also have an oversized wall plate included to cover up any left-behind screw holes or blemishes that may be to either side of the mounting location as a result of prior device installations.
