### Grandstream GDS3712 Single-Gang Mounting Adapter and Oversized Wall Plate

This is a single-gang box mounting plate adapter for the Grandstream GDS3712 doorbell/intercom. It may also work with other similar GDS37xx models such as the GDS3702, GDS3705, and GDS3710.

This was designed to use the stock steel mounting plate intended for flush mount on a wall, and adapt that to a North American single-gang electrical box. You will also need 4 #8 x 1/2" machine screws to mount the plate to the adapter. The #8 screws should thread directly into the 3D printed plastic, however you may optionally also use 4 corresponding #8 nuts to re-inforce the attachment from behind the adapter plate. If using nuts, first thread the screws in place, then attach the nuts from behind the plate to ensure proper thread alignment. I would then recommend using a small dab of cyanoacrylate glue (Super Glue) to hold the nuts in place. You can then disassemble the steel plate from the bracket to mount the adapter to the wall.

I also have an oversized wall plate included to cover up any left-behind screw holes or blemishes that may be to either side of the mounting location as a result of prior device installations.
